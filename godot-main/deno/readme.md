Notes taken while making this project:

- In this project, we will make 3 independent scenes: Player, Mob, and HUD, which we will combine into the game's Main scene.

- In a larger project, it might be useful to create folders to hold the various scenes and their scripts, but for this relatively small game, you can save your scenes and scripts in the project's root folder, identified by res://. You can see your project folders in the FileSystem dock in the lower left corner:
	
	
- Creating the player sceneÔÉÅ

- With the project settings in place, we can start working on the player-controlled character.

- The first scene will define the Player object. One of the benefits of creating a separate Player scene is that we can test it separately, even before we've created other parts of the game.
