Game dev Concepts:

- **Sprites**: sprites are objects in a game that move and interact. the empty space in a sprite is useless, so we use bounding box.
- **Sprite sheet**: animation frame kept next to each other
- **tile sets**: elements of game levels.
- **game Jam**:  event where participants make video games (itch.io)
    - gmtk game jam
