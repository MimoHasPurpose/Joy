Game dev Concepts:

- **Sprites**: sprites are objects in a game that move and interact. the empty space in a sprite is useless, so we use bounding box.
- **Sprite sheet**: animation frame kept next to each other
- **tile sets**: elements of game levels.
- **game Jam**:  event where participants make video games (itch.io)
    - gmtk game jam
- **Level**: level is where game happens, different level offer variation. [level design link](https://book.leveldesignbook.com/introduction)
- **Platformer**: jump and run game
- **catlikecoding**: https://catlikecoding.com/
- **playtest**: testing a game for bugs and design flaws
